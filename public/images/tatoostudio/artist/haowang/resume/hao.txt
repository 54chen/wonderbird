About the Artist
Welcome to my world of ink and artistry! My name is Hao Wang, and I am a passionate tattoo artist with a rich background in sculpting and design. Before dedicating my craft to the world of tattoos, I honed my skills as a sculptor at the renowned Weta Workshop.

A Journey Through Sculpting
My journey as an artist began with sculpting, where I was privileged to work at Weta Workshop, one of the most prestigious special effects and prop companies in the world. During my time there, I had the incredible opportunity to create detailed figures for Netflix's acclaimed series, Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. Each piece was crafted with meticulous attention to detail and a deep appreciation for the art of storytelling. I'm proud to say that these figures were immensely popular and sold out, a testament to the dedication and passion I poured into each creation.

Transition to Tattooing
Transitioning from sculpting to tattooing was a natural progression for me. The skills and precision required in sculpting seamlessly translated into my tattoo work. I bring the same level of dedication, artistry, and attention to detail to every tattoo I design. Each piece is a unique work of art, tailored to tell the story and capture the essence of my clients' visions.

My Artistic Philosophy
In both sculpting and tattooing, my philosophy remains the same: to create art that resonates deeply with the individual, telling their story in a way that is both beautiful and meaningful. Whether it's a small, intricate design or a large, elaborate piece, I approach each tattoo with the same passion and commitment to excellence.

Thank you for considering me for your next tattoo. I look forward to collaborating with you to create a piece of art that you'll cherish forever.
